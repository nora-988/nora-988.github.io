  <h3 class="titled">Dunder Mifflin Sabre</h3>
  <h5>
Regional Manager
2009-2012</h5>
<p>
  Broad decision-making authority on branch operations. I place those responsabilities secondary to my desire to be friends with my employees. On the other hand, I also overstep my authority by hosting events that Corporate disapproves. The Dundies is my best project.
<ul>
Key Contributions:

  <li>Brief bouts of surprising insight</li>
  <li>Laid-back approach often results in lower than expected workplace productivity</li>
  <li>Scapegoating employees to cover myself</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<h3 class="titled">Dunder Mifflin Company</h3>

  <h5>Regional Manager 1994</h5>
<p>
  In charge of Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin. Loyal to the company, trying to help my employeed when they endure difficulties. I spend 80 percent of my time “distracting others,” 19 percent of my time “procrastinating,” and 1 percent of my time “critical thinking.” Still, we have the best sales records of the entire company.
<ul>
Key Contributions:

  <li>Joking around and treating professional colleagues as personal friends</li>
  <li>Silly conversations used to secure major sales</li>
  <li>Spread my famous quote "That's what she said" and use it in inappropriate circumstances.</li>
</ul>

     <h3 class="titled">Prison Mike</h3>
<p>
  He wears a purple bandana over his head, he is in prison for theft, robbery and kidnapping the president's son for ransom.<br>

He taught me everything I need to know as being scared of Dementors.
</p>
<h3 class="titled">Michael the Magic</h3>
<p>
  The best magician in the world. He tried to escape from a straitjacket once but failed because he lost the key, rumour has it Jim Halpert hid it.<br>

He knows numerous magic tricks. He attended magic camps.
